							<h3>Quizzes help students learn</h3>
							<p>Cognitive psychology strongly suggests that the act of retrieving information directly helps students learn. This benefit occurs even in the absence of feedback and in the absence of an opportunity to restudy the information. The process of retrieval – bringing the information to mind – actually leads to learning all by itself. What’s more, bringing the information to mind can sometimes improve students’ ability to apply the information in new situations.</p>

							<h3>Studying is more efficient after a quiz</h3>
							<p>Quizzes help students identify what they know and what they don’t know. The students then have a better idea of how well they are grasping the material, hopefully motivating them to study more and helping them allocate their study time effectively by focusing on the information that still needs more practice. What’s more, though, in some cases a test can make the next study opportunity more effective. Teachers can help students see what topics they are not grasping by providing feedback after quizzes; and that feedback need not be immediate to be most effective.</p>

						<div class="feature">
							<h3>Quizzes increase attendance</h3>
							<p>When in-class quizzes are frequent, students need to be in class in order to take the quizzes. For example, If you give pop-extra-credit-quizzes, your students know that they can only get extra credit from the quizzes if they are present in class. So, by providing random extra-credit quizzes, you can motivate your students to attend, and to come prepared for class.</p>
